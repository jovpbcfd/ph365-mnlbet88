          Spend some time getting used to the game layout before you start
          playing. Even though most Fish Hunter games have simple controls, you
          should still know how the fishing line works, how to change your bets,
          and where to find bonuses and other features inside the game. There is
          also a help area in our games, so you can quickly learn how to play
          and win.

          As soon as you feel good with the game, you can start fishing! Point
          your gun, shoot, and try to get as many fish as you can. You can get
          more levels, power-ups, and jackpots as you catch more fish. Your
          gains will also grow with each catch. The better your shots, the more
          likely it is that you will catch a rare and expensive fish.
