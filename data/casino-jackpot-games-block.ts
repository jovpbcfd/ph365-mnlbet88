Fixed jackpots, on the other hand, always pay out the same amount. Each time a player bets or spins the reels, some of their money goes into the bonus pool. This helps to build the prize. This circle keeps going, which lets the prize grow to amazing amounts—often in the millions of pesos—giving one lucky player a chance that could change their whole life.`,
