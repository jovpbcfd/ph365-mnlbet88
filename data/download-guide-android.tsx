          Your phone must first install applications from outside the Google
          Play Store before installation. Here is how:

        <ul className="list-disc pb-2">
          <li>Open Settings</li>
          <li>Press Security</li>
          <li>Press Device Management</li>
          <li>Look for the Install Unknown Apps or Unknown Sources choice</li>
          <li>Turn it on for your browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox)</li>
        </ul>

          Open your Downloads folder to locate the APK file you just downloaded.

          It's a good idea to return to Settings &gt; Security and switch off
          the "Install Unknown Apps" option once the program is installed to
          maintain your phone security.
