          Most Fish Hunters' basic mechanics center on aiming and shooting a
          fishing line to capture different kinds of fish. Players target fish
          on the screen by varying the direction, force, and speed of a virtual
          fishing rod or line. The worth of the fish you catch ranges; rarer
          species pay more.

          Usually, participants start by betting before even playing. This bet
          is very important because it affects how much you could win based on
          the fish you catch. Aiming your fishing line and shooting it at the
          fish marks the true difficulty once your bet is put. Capturing a fish
          successfully yields a payoff; the value of the fish will define your
          earnings.
