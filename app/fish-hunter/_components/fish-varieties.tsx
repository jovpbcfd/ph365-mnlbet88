          Not all fish are made equally in Fish Hunter.Different types of fish
          are harder to find than others, and each one has its own value. While
          ordinary fish are more readily obtained and pay less, rare and
          legendary fish can give players large sums. Understanding the worth
          and behavior of many fish species will help you to raise your chances
          of huge wins.

          Sometimes their speed or secretiveness makes particular fish more
          difficult to find. Maximizing your income depends on knowing these
          fish&apos;s behavior and modifying your approach. Certain games also
          have rare species or bonus fish that set off unique abilities, hence
          enhancing the gameplay&apos;s thrills.
