          Play Fan Tan: How do you do it?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fan Tan, like all other early Chinese games, is played with little
            beads or tokens whereby the winner bets on how many of such tokens
            will remain out of the overall count divided by a specific amount.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simultaneously one can gamble based on the outcome of split groups
            of numbers.
          </li>
          <li>At the bottom of the ranking system the cards follow is aces.</li>
          <li>
            The dealer counts the beads; the last group is the winner; the
            remaining portion differs.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is an actively developing game, and the enthusiasm is grown by
            most often repeated resolutions of bets within a few seconds.
